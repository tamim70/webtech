We believe we can change the existing accommodation system of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Our mission is to give high-quality facilities at a 
cheaper rate to our member. <br>
The culture, a product of the time, has changed significantly over the past few years
For a time, unmarried single men or women discovered that it was nigh-impossible to find housing in Dhaka. Despite the surge of apartments, homeowners were suspicious and hostile in many cases towards individuals seeking to live without their family.

 3.0 (we define original agricultural societies city as City 1.0, industrialized societies city as City 2.0), it pushes the urban infrastructure
 shared model into a more intensive and efficient stage. This City 3.0 revolution will come more rapid in developing countries where overcrowding
 and lack of infrastructure seriously. Obviously imitate practices of occident cities by the slowly progressive way to solve the urgent urban
 problems in developing countries is not a desirable way. The income gap and social disparities between developed countries and developing 
 countries, are not dozens of percent, but dozens of times. There is no doubt that for these huge numbers of low-income people, who account
 for more than half of the world's population, need a tailored and revolutionary solution! Its great significance will not less than the
